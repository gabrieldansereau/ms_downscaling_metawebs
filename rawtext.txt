# Introduction

Here, we present a method to downscale a metaweb in space by developing
an explicit spatial probabilistic metaweb for Canadian mammals. We
present how the spatial structure of the downscaled metaweb varies in
space and how the uncertainty of interactions can be made spatially
explicit. We further show that the downscaled metaweb can highlight
important biodiversity areas and bring novel ecological insights
compared to community measures.

# Methods

Fig. 1 shows a conceptual overview of the methodological steps leading
to the downscaled metaweb. The components were grouped as the inputs
(spatial or non-spatial), the localized steps (divided into
single-species-level, two-species-level, and network-level steps), and
the final downscaled and spatialized output. Throughout these steps, we
highlight the importance of presenting the uncertainty of both
interactions and their distribution in space. We argue that this
requires adopting a probabilistic view and incorporating variation
between scales.

![Figure 1: Conceptual figure of the workflow to obtain the spatial
probabilistic metaweb (Chapter 1). The workflow has three components:
the inputs, the localized steps, and the final spatial output. The
inputs are composed of the spatial data (data with information in every
cell) and the non-spatial data (constant for all of Canada). The
localized steps use these data and are performed separately in every
cell, first at a single-species level (using distribution data), then
for every species pair (adding interaction data from the metaweb), and
finally at the network level by combining the results of all species
pairs. The final output coming out of the network-level steps contains a
spatialized probabilistic metaweb for every cell across the study
extent.](figures/conceptual-figure.png){#fig:conceptual}

## Inputs

The inputs were divided into two main categories: the spatial and
non-spatial ones (*Inputs* box on Fig. 1).

### Non-spatial inputs

The main building block for the interaction data was the metaweb for
Canadian mammals from @Strydom2022FooWeb, a non-spatial input
(represented as nodes and links on Fig. 1). A metaweb contains all the
possible interactions between the species found in a given regional
species pool [@Dunne2006NetStr]. The species list for the Canadian
metaweb was extracted from the International Union for the Conservation
of Nature (IUCN) checklist [@Strydom2022FooWeb]. Briefly, the metaweb
was developed using graph embedding and phylogenetic transfer learning
based on the metaweb of European mammals, which is itself based on a
comprehensive survey of interactions reported in the scientific
literature [@Maiorano2020TetSpe]. The Canadian metaweb is probabilistic,
which has the advantage of taking into account that species do not
necessarily interact whenever they co-occur [@Blanchet2020CoOcc].
However, the Canadian metaweb is not explicitly spatial: it only gives
information on interactions in Canada as a whole and does not represent
networks at specific locations. Local networks, on the other hand, are
realizations from the metaweb resulting from sorting the species and the
interactions [@Poisot2015SpeWhy]. A spatial and localized metaweb is not
equivalent to the local networks, as it will have a different structure
and a higher connectance [@Strydom2022PreMet]. Therefore, producing a
spatial metaweb requires additional steps to account for species
composition and interaction variability in space.

### Spatial inputs

The spatial data used to develop the spatial component of the metaweb
were species occurrences and environmental data. First, we extracted
species occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF; www.gbif.org) for the Canadian mammals after reconciling species
names between the Canadian metaweb and GBIF using the GBIF Backbone
Taxonomy [@GBIFSecretariat2021GbiBac]. Doing so, we removed potential
duplicates where species listed in the Canadian metaweb are considered
as a single species by GBIF. We collected occurrences for our species
list using the GBIF download API on October 21st 2022
[@GBIF.org2022GbiOcc]. We restricted our query to occurrences with
coordinates between longitudes 175°W to 45°W and latitudes 10°N to 90°N.
This was meant to collect training data covering a broader range than
our prediction target (Canada only) and include observations in similar
environments. Then, since GBIF observations represent presence-only data
and most predictive models require absence data, we generated
pseudo-absence data using the surface range envelope method available in
`SimpleSDMLayers.jl` [@Dansereau2021SimJl]. This method generates
pseudo-absences by selecting random non-observed locations within the
spatial range delimited by the presence data [@Barbet-Massin2012SelPse].

We used environmental data and species distribution models [SDMs,
@Guisan2005PreSpe] to predict the distribution of Canadian mammals
across the whole country. The environmental data we used were the 19
bioclimatic variables from CHELSA [@Karger2017CliHig] and the 12
consensus land cover variables from EarthEnv [@Tuanmu2014Glo1km]. The
CHELSA bioclimatic variables (*bio1-bio19*) represent various measures
of temperature and precipitation (e.g., annual averages, monthly maximum
or minimum, seasonality) and are available for land areas across the
globe. Therefore, they can be used to capture the climatic tolerance of
species and model habitat suitability in new locations. We used the most
recent version, the CHELSA v2.1 dataset [@Karger2021CliHig]. However,
this version also includes bioclimatic data for open water, while we
decided here to focus only on land surfaces. We used the previous
version, CHELSA v1.2 [@Karger2018DatCli], which shares a similar grid
but does not cover open water, as a mask to clip the v2.1 data to land
surfaces only. The EarthEnv land cover variables represent classes such
as Evergreen broadleaf trees, Cultivated and managed vegetation,
Urban/Built-up, and Open Water. Values range between 0 and 100 and
represent the consensus prevalence of each class in percentage within a
pixel. We coarsened both the CHELSA and EarthEnv data from their
original 30 arc-second resolution to a 2.5 arc-mininute one (around 4.5
km at the Equator) using @GDAL/OGRcontributors2021GdaOgr. This
represented a compromise to catch both local variations and broad scale
patterns while limiting computation costs to a manageable level, as
memory requirements on localized interactions rise very quickly.

Our selection criteria for choosing an SDM algorithm was to have a
method that generated probabilistic results, including both a
probability of occurrence for a species in a specific location and the
uncertainty associated with the prediction. These were crucial to
obtaining a probabilistic version of the metaweb as they were used to
create spatial variations in the localized interaction probabilities
(see next section). One promising method for this is Gradient Boosted
Trees with a Gaussian maximum likelihood from the `EvoTrees.jl` *Julia*
package (https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl). This method returns a
prediction for every pixel with an average value and a standard
deviation, which we used as a measure of uncertainty to build a Normal
distribution for the probability of occurrence of a given species at all
pixels (represented as probability distributions on Fig. 1). We trained
models across the extent chosen for occurrences (longitudes 175°W to
45°W and latitudes 10°N to 90°N), then predicted species distributions
only for Canada. We used the 2021 Census Boundary Files from Statistics
Canada [@StatisticsCanada2022BouFil] to set the boundaries for our
predictions.

## Localized steps

The next part of the method was the localized steps which produce local
metawebs in every pixel. This component was divided into single-species,
two-species, and network-level steps (*Localized steps* box on Fig. 1).

The single-species steps represented four possible ways to account for
uncertainty in the species distributions and bring variation to the
spatial metaweb. We explored four different options to select a value
from the occurrence distributions obtained in the previous steps (Inputs
section): 1) taking the mean from the distribution as the probability of
occurrence (option 1 on Fig. 1); 2) converting the mean value to a
binary one using a specific threshold per species (option 2); 3)
sampling a random value within the Normal distribution (option 3); 4)
converting the random value into a binary result (option 4). The
threshold ($\tau$ on Fig. 1) used was the value that maximized Youden's
*J* informedness statistic [@Youden1950IndRat], the same metric used by
@Strydom2022FooWeb at an intermediate step while building the metaweb.
The four sampling options were intended to explore how uncertainty and
variation in the species distributions can affect the metaweb result and
reproduce some of the filterings that create the local network
realizations [@Poisot2015SpeWhy]. We expected thresholding to have a
more pronounced effect on network structure as it should reduce the
number of links by removing many of the rare interactions
[@Poisot2016StrPro]. Meanwhile, we expected random sampling to create
spatial heterogeneity compared to the mean probabilities, as including
some extreme values should disrupt the potential effects of
environmental gradients.

Next, the two-species steps aimed to give the probability of observing a
given interaction in a location. For all species pairs, we multiplied
the two species' occurrence probability obtained using the sampling
options described in the previous paragraph, then multiplied the
co-occurrence probability by the interaction probability from the
Canadian metaweb. For cases where species in the Canadian metaweb were
considered as the same species by the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (the
reconciliation step mentioned earlier), we used the highest interaction
probabilities involving the duplicated species.

The network-level steps then created the probabilistic metaweb for the
location. We assembled all the local interaction probabilities (from the
two-species steps) into a probabilistic network [@Poisot2016StrPro]. We
then sampled several random network realizations to represent the
potential local realization process [@Poisot2015SpeWhy]. Finally, this
resulted in a distribution of localized networks, which we averaged over
the number of simulations to obtain a probabilistic network.

## Outputs

The final output of our method was the spatial probabilistic metaweb,
which contains a localized probabilistic metaweb in every cell across
the student extent (Outputs box on Fig. 1). This gives us an idea of the
possible networks in all locations as the metaweb essentially serves to
set an upper bound on the potential interactions [@Strydom2022PreMet],
but with the added benefit of accounting for co-occurrence probabilities
in this case. From there, we can create maps of network properties
(e.g. number of links, connectance) measured on the local realizations,
display their spatial distribution, and compute some community-level
measures such as species richness. We can also calculate the uncertainty
associated with the network and community measurements and contrast
their spatial distribution (see Supplementary Material).

### Ecoregions

Since both species composition and network summary values display a high
spatial variation and complex patterns, we simplified the representation
of their distribution by grouping sites by ecoregion, as species and
interaction composition have been shown to differ between ecoregions
across large spatial scales [@Martins2022GloReg]. To do so, we used the
global map of ecoregions from [@Dinerstein2017EcoApp; also used by
@Martins2022GloReg], rasterized it, and clipped it to Canada, which
selected 44 different ecoregions. For every measure we report
(e.g. species richness, number of links), we first calculated the
measure for every site separately, then we extracted the median value
for each ecoregion. We also measured the within-ecoregion variation by
measuring the 89% interquantile range of the values in each ecoregion
[threshold chosen to avoid confusion with conventional significance
tests, inspired by @McElreath2020StaRet].

### Ecological uniqueness

We compared the compositional uniqueness of the networks and the
communities to verify if they indicated different exceptional areas. We
measured uniqueness using the local contributions to beta diversity
[LCBD, @Legendre2013BetDiv], which identify sites with exceptional
composition by quantifying how much one site contributes to the total
variance in the community composition. While many studies used LCBD
values to evaluate uniqueness on local scales or few study sites [for
example, @daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017ExpSpe], recent studies used the
measure on predicted species compositions over broad spatial extents and
a large number of sites [@Vasconcelos2018ExpImp; @Dansereau2022EvaEco].
LCBD values can also be used to measure uniqueness for networks by
computing the values over the adjacency matrix, which has been shown to
capture more unique sites and uniqueness variability than through
species composition [@Poisot2017HosPar]. Here, we measured and compared
the uniqueness of our localized community and network predictions. We
were especially interested in seeing if the sites identified as unique
were the same based on the species and the interactions or if this
method allowed identifying areas unique for one element (interactions,
for instance) but not the other. Sites with such mismatches should
warrant more investigation to understand the reasons for this
difference.

## Software

We used *Julia* v1.9.0 [@Bezanson2017JulFre] to implement all our
analyses. We used packages `GBIF.jl` [@Dansereau2021SimJl] to reconcile
species names using the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy,
`SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl` to handle raster layers and species
occurrences, `EcologicalNetworks.jl` [@Poisot2019EcoJl] to analyse
network and metaweb structure, and `Makie.jl` [@Danisch2021MakJl] to
produce figures. Our data sources (CHELSA, EarthEnv, Ecoregions) were
all unprojected and we did not use a projection in our analyses, but we
displayed the results using a Lambert conformal conic projection more
appropriate for Canada using `GeoMakie.jl`. All the code used to
implement our analyses is available on GitHub
(https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpatialProbabilisticMetaweb) and includes
instructions on how to run a smaller example at a coarse resolution.
Note that running our analyses at full scale is resource and memory
intensive and required the use of compute clusters provided by Calcul
Québec and the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.

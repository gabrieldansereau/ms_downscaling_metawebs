                <dd>Knowledge about how ecological networks vary across
            global scales is currently limited given the complexity of
            acquiring repeated data for species interactions. Yet,
            recent developments of metawebs—lists of potential
            interactions between species in a given species
            pool—highlight efficient ways to document interactions first
            on broader scales. Downscaling metawebs towards local
            network predictions is therefore a promising approach to use
            current data to investigate the variation of networks across
            space. However, issues remain in how to represent the
            spatial variability and uncertainty of species interactions,
            especially for large scale food webs. Here, we present a
            probabilistic framework to downscale a metaweb based on the
            Canadian mammal metaweb and species occurrences from GBIF.
            We investigate how this approach can be used to represent
            the variability of networks and communities between
            ecoregions in Canada. Our results show that community
            metrics (species richness) and network metrics (number of
            links) differ in how they vary within and between
            ecoregions. This allows us to identify variability hotspots
            unique for different biodiversity aspects. Given recent
            developments on similar probabilistic metawebs, our approach
            highlights how there are now many opportunities in various
            systems for local predictions of networks across broad
            spatial scales.</dd>

            <p>Despite these limitations, food web ecologists often can
            infer a reasonable approximation of the network existing
            within a region. This representation, called a metaweb,
            contains all possible interactions between species in a

            <p>When assembled by integrating different data sources
            (potentially with additional predictive steps), the metaweb
            allows to overcome sampling limitations to upscale network
            data to a global scale. For example, <span class="citation"

            (2019)</span> coupled data on fish distribution with a
            statistical model of trophic interaction to provide
            estimates of the potential food web structure at the global
            scale. Recent studies have focused on assembling metawebs
            for various taxa through literature surveys and expert
            elicitation <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Maiorano2020TetSpe">(European tetrapods,

            scale, the locally observed food webs [“realization” of the

            data-cites="Saravia2022EcoNet">(Saravia <em>et al.</em>

            structure the core goal of predictive network ecology, as if
            there is a strong link between the metaweb and its local
            realizations, strong predictions of the metaweb have the
            potential to bring us closer to producing accurate local
            (downscaled) predictions. Therefore, establishing or
            predicting the metaweb should be the first target for
            systems lacking information about local realizations. This
            is not the same as using interactions to improve predictions
            of species distributions, as recent studies have done <span

            different task, and it serves another goal: focusing first
            on the distribution of network structures and its drivers
            rather than on the distribution of species.</p>
            <p>Explicit spatial predictions (such as downscaled metaweb
            predictions) are essential as they will allow comparisons
            with extant work for species-rich communities. Recent

            (2022)</span> found a strong spatial coupling between

            captures more composition variability than community
            uniqueness and that sites with exceptional compositions
            might differ for networks and communities, because species
            distributions and species interactions had different
            bioclimatic drivers. Spatialized network data will allow
            these comparisons, identifying important conservation

            <p>A key challenge remains in how to downscale a regional
            metaweb towards local network predictions reflecting the
            spatial variability of interactions. Even when the metaweb
            is known, local networks may vary substantially and differ

            <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span>, emphasizing the need for
            methods to generate local, downscaled network predictions. A
            potential limitation to previous downscaling approaches is
            that they assume interactions are constant across space,
            which ignores well-documenter interaction variability, and
            masks the effect of environmental conditions on interaction
            realization <span class="citation"

            interactions as probabilistic events (rather than binary

            <span class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot

            and showed how it could be used for interaction distribution
            modelling. This approach to downscaling is relevant when
            combined with in situ observations of interactions and local
            networks to train interaction models (in this case, with

            where hundreds of species result in tens of thousands of
            species pair that may potentially interact. We currently
            lack a downscaling framework that is both probabilistic and
            can be trained without replicated in situ interaction data.
            Additionally, a probabilistic view can allow propagating
            uncertainty, which can play a key role in evaluating the
            quality of the predictions. Assessing model uncertainty
            would enable us to determine to which degree we should trust
            our predictions and to identify what to do to improve the
            current knowledge.</p>
            <p>Here, we present a method to downscale a metaweb in
            space, and illustrate it by spatially reconstructing local
            instances of a probabilistic metaweb of Canadian mammals. We
            do so using a probabilistic approach to both species
            distributions and interactions in a system without spatially
            replicated interaction data. We then explore how the spatial
            structure of the downscaled metaweb varies in space and how
            the uncertainty of interactions can be made spatially
            explicit. We further show that the downscaled metaweb can
            highlight important biodiversity areas and bring novel
            ecological insights compared to traditional community
            measures like species richness.</p>

            <p>Fig. 1 shows a conceptual overview of the methodological
            steps leading to the downscaled metaweb. The components were
            grouped as non-spatial and spatial inputs, localized site
            steps (divided into single-species-level, two-species-level,
            and network-level steps), and the final downscaled and
            spatialized metaweb. Throughout these steps, we highlight
            the importance of presenting the uncertainty of interactions
            and their distribution in space. We argue that this requires
            adopting a probabilistic view and incorporating variation
            between scales.</p>

            <h3 id="metaweb">Metaweb</h3>
            <p>The main source of interaction data was the metaweb for
            Canadian mammals from <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2022a)</span>, which is a-spatial, i.e., it represents
            interactions between mammals that can occur anywhere in
            Canada. The species list for the Canadian metaweb was
            extracted from the International Union for the Conservation
            of Nature (IUCN) checklist <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2022a)</span>. Briefly, the metaweb was developed using
            graph embedding and phylogenetic transfer learning based on
            the metaweb of European mammals, which is itself based on a
            comprehensive survey of interactions reported in the
            scientific literature <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Maiorano2020TetSpe">(Maiorano <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. The Canadian metaweb is probabilistic, which
            has the advantage of reflecting the likelihood of an
            interaction taking place given the phylogenetic and trait
            match between two species. This allows incorporating
            interaction variability between species (i.e., taking into
            account that two species may not always interact whenever or
            wherever they occur); however, we highlight that other
            factors beyond trait and phylogenetic matching (e.g.,
            population densities) will also contribute to observed
            interaction frequencies.</p>
            <h3 id="species-occurrences">Species occurrences</h3>
            <p>The downscaling of the metaweb involved combining it with
            species occurrence and environmental data. First, we
            extracted species occurrences from the Global Biodiversity
            Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org) for the Canadian
            mammals after reconciling species names between the Canadian
            metaweb and GBIF using the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="GBIFSecretariat2021GbiBac">(GBIF Secretariat
            2021)</span>. This step removed potential duplicates by
            combining species listed in the Canadian metaweb which were
            considered as a single entity by GBIF. We collected
            occurrences for the updated species list (159 species) using
            the GBIF download API on October 21st 2022 <span
            class="citation" data-cites="GBIF.org2022GbiOcc">(GBIF.org
            2022)</span>. We restricted our query to occurrences with
            coordinates between longitudes 175°W to 45°W and latitudes
            10°N to 90°N. This was meant to collect training data
            covering a broader range than our prediction target (Canada
            only) and include observations in similar environments.
            Then, since GBIF observations represent presence-only data
            and most predictive models require absence data, we
            generated pseudo-absence data using the surface range
            envelope method, which selects random non-observed sites
            within the spatial range delimited by the presence data

            monthly maximum or minimum, seasonality) and are available
            for land areas across the globe. We used the most recent
            version, the CHELSA v2.1 dataset <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Karger2021CliHig">(Karger <em>et al.</em>

            land-cover variables represent classes such as Evergreen
            broadleaf trees, Cultivated and managed vegetation,
            Urban/Built-up, and Open Water. Values range between 0 and
            100 and represent the consensus prevalence of each class in
            percentage within a pixel (hereafter called sites). We
            coarsened both the CHELSA and EarthEnv data from their
            original 30 arc-second resolution to a 2.5 arc-minute one
            (around 4.5 km at the Equator) using GDAL <span

            capturing both local variations and broad-scale patterns

            <p>Our selection criteria for choosing an SDM algorithm was

            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">(similar to
            Gravel <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>, including both a
            probability of occurrence for a species in a specific site
            and the uncertainty associated with the prediction. These
            were crucial to obtaining a probabilistic version of the
            metaweb as they were used to create spatial variations in
            the localized interaction probabilities (see next section).
            One suitable method for this is Gradient Boosted Trees with
            a Gaussian maximum likelihood from the
            <code>EvoTrees.jl</code> <em>Julia</em> package
            (https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl). This method
            returns a prediction for every site with an average value
            and a standard deviation, which we used as a measure of
            uncertainty to build a Normal distribution for the
            probability of occurrence of a given species at all sites
            (represented as probability distributions on Fig. 1). We
            trained models across the extent chosen for occurrences
            (longitudes 175°W to 45°W and latitudes 10°N to 90°N), then
            predicted species distributions only for Canada. We used the

            <p>The next part of the method was the localized steps which

            divided into single-species, two-species, and network-level
            steps (<em>Localized steps</em> box on Fig. 1).</p>
            <p>The single-species steps represented four possible ways
            to account for uncertainty in the species distributions and
            bring variation to the spatial metaweb. We explored four
            different options to select a value (<em>P(occurrence)</em>;
            Fig. 1) from the occurrence distributions obtained in the
            previous steps: 1) taking the mean from the distribution as
            the probability of occurrence (option 1 on Fig. 1); 2)
            converting the mean value to a binary one using a specific
            threshold per species (option 2); 3) sampling a random value
            within the Normal distribution (option 3); or 4) converting
            a random value into a binary result (option 4, using a
            separate draw from option 3 and the same threshold as in
            option 2). The threshold (<span
            class="math inline"><em>τ</em></span> on Fig. 1) used was
            the value that maximized Youden’s <em>J</em> informedness

            metaweb. The four sampling options were intended to explore
            how uncertainty and variation in the species distributions
            can affect the metaweb result. We expected thresholding to
            have a more pronounced effect on network structure as it
            should reduce the number of links by removing many of the
            rare interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span>. Meanwhile, we expected random sampling to
            create spatial heterogeneity compared to the mean
            probabilities, as including some extreme values should
            confound the potential effects of environmental gradients.
            We chose option 1 as the default to present results as it is
            intuitive and essentially represents the result of a

            <p>Next, the two-species steps were aimed at assigning a
            probability of observing an interaction between two species
            in a given site. For each species pair, we multiplied the
            product of the two species’ occurrence probabilities
            (<em>P(co-occurrence</em>); Fig. 1) (obtained using one of
            the sampling options above) by their interaction probability

            Canadian metaweb were considered as the same species by the
            GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (the reconciliation step mentioned
            earlier), we used the highest interaction probabilities
            involving the duplicated species.</p>
            <p>The network-level steps then created the probabilistic
            metaweb for the site. We assembled all the local interaction
            probabilities (from the two-species steps) into a

            differs from a local realization, from which it should have
            a different structure. Nonetheless, from the downscaled

            <p>Our method allowed us to display the spatial distribution
            of ecoregion-level community measures (here, expected
            species richness) and network measures (expected number of
            links; Fig. 2). We highlight that the community and
            network-level measures presented here are not actual
            predictions of the measure itself (e.g., we do not present a
            prediction of actual species richness at each location).
            Instead, they are the reflection of these metrics from the
            localized predictions of the communities and networks
            obtained from the downscaling of the metaweb, then
            summarized for the ecoregions (using the median value as a
            way to protect against long tails in the distributions).
            Expected ecoregion richness (Fig. 2A) and expected number of
            links (Fig. 2B) displayed similar distributions with a
            latitudinal gradient and higher values in the south.
            However, within-ecoregion variability was distributed
            differently, as some ecoregions along the coasts displayed
            higher interquantile ranges while ecoregions around the
            southern border displayed narrower ones (Fig. 2C-D). All
            results shown are based on the first sampling strategy
            (option 1) mentioned in the <em>Building site-level
            instances of the metaweb</em> section, where species
            occurrence probabilities were taken as the mean value of the
            distribution (results for other sampling strategies are

            <p>Direct comparison of the spatial distributions of species
            richness and expected number of links showed some areas with
            mismatches, both regarding the median estimates and
            regarding the within-ecoregion variability (Fig. 3). Median
            values for the ecoregions showed a similar bivariate
            distribution, with ecoregions in the south mostly displaying
            high species richness and a high number of links (Fig. 3A).
            The northernmost ecoregions (Canadian High Artic Tundra and
            Davis Highlands Tundra) displayed higher richness (based on
            the quantile rank) compared to the number of links.
            Inversely, ecoregions further south (Canadian Low Artic
            Tundra, Northern Canadian Shield Taiga, Southern Hudson Bay
            Taiga) ranked higher for the number of links than for
            species richness. On the other hand, within-ecoregion
            variability showed different bivariate relationships and a
            less constant latitudinal gradient (Fig. 3B). This indicates
            that richness and links do not co-vary completely
            (i.e. their variability is not closely connected) although
            they may show similar distributions for median values.</p>

            <p>Our results also indicate a mismatch between the
            uniqueness of communities and networks (Fig. 4). Uniqueness
            was higher mostly in the north and along the south border
            for communities, but only in the north for networks
            (Fig. 4A-B). Consequently, ecoregions with both unique
            community composition and unique network composition were
            mostly in the north (Fig. 4C). Meanwhile, some areas were
            unique for one element but not the other. For instance, the
            New England-Acadian forests ecoregion (south-east, near 70°W
            and 48°N) had a highly unique species composition but a more
            common network composition (Fig. 4C). Opposite areas with
            unique network compositions only were observed at higher
            between latitudes 52°N and 70°N (Eastern Canadian Shield
            Taiga, Northern Canadian Shield Taiga, Canadian Low Artic
            Tundra). Also, network uniqueness values for ecoregions
            spanned a narrower range between the 44 ecoregions than
            species LCBD values (Fig. 4D, left). Within-ecoregion
            variation was also lower for network values with generally
            lower 89% interquantile ranges among the site-level LCBD
            values (Fig. 4D, right). Moreover, mismatched sites (unique
            for only one element) formed two distinct groups when
            evaluating the relationship between species richness and the
            number of links (see Supplementary Material). The areas only
            unique for their species composition had both a high
            richness and number of links. On the other hand, the sites
            only unique for their networks had both lower richness and a
            lower number of links, although they were not the sites with
            the lowest values for both.</p>

            (Fig. 3), highlighting that interactions might vary
            differently than species distributions even over
            continental-scale gradients. Network density (links on
            Fig. 3A) were also lower in the north, contrarily to
            previous studies where connectance was higher in the north,
            although those were in Europe for all tetrapods <span

            <p>Our LCBD and uniqueness results highlighted that areas
            with unique network composition differ from sites with
            unique species composition. In other words, the joint
            distribution of community and network uniqueness highlights
            different diversity hotspots. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2017HosPar">Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            (2017)</span> showed a similar result with host-parasite
            communities of rodents and ectoparasitic fleas. Our results
            further show how these differences could be distributed
            across ecoregions and a broad spatial extent. Areas unique
            for only one element (species or network composition)
            differed in their combination of species richness and number
            of links (supplementary material), with species-unique sites
            displaying high values of both measures and network-unique
            sites displaying low values. Moreover, LCBD scores
            essentially highlight variability hotspots and are a measure
            of the variance of community or network structure. Here,
            they also serve as an inter-ecoregion variation measure,
            which can be compared to the within-ecoregion variation
            highlighted by the interquantile ranges. The narrower range
            of values for network LCBD values and the lower IQR values
            indicate that both the inter-ecoregion and within-ecoregion
            variation are lower for networks than for species (Fig. 4).
            Additionally, higher values for network LCBD also indicate
            that most ecoregions can hold ecologically unique sites.</p>
            <p>When to use the method we presented here will depend on
            the availability of interaction data or existing metawebs,
            and on the intent to incorporate interaction variability, as
            well as ecoregion-level variability. In systems where in
            situ interaction and network data are available, the
            approach put forward by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span> achieves a similar purpose as we attempted
            here, but is more rigourous and allows modelling the effect
            of the environment on the interactions themselves. Without
            such data, establishing or predicting the metaweb should be
            the first step toward producing localized predictions <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2022PreMet">(Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> 2022b)</span>. Well-documented binary
            metawebs such as the European tetrapod metaweb could be
            partly combined with our approach if used with probabilistic
            SDMs and summarized by ecoregions (as they would only lack
            an initial probabilistic metaweb, but would still obtain a
            more probabilistic output). Our approach will essentially
            differ from previous attempts in how it perceives
            uncertainty and variability. For instance, rare interactions
            should not be over-represented <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span> and should have lesser effects over computed
            network measures. Furthermore, summarizing results by
            ecoregion allows for showing variation within and between
            ecologically meaningful biogeographic boundaries <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Martins2022GloReg">(Martins
            <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>, which, as our results showed,
            is not constant across space and can help identify
            contrasting diversity hotspots.</p>
            <p>The recent shift in focus towards building metawebs opens
            many opportunities for projections of networks in space
            through probabilistic downscaling, as we suggested here.
            Metawebs have been documented in many systems, allowing us
            to build new ones from predictions. How the European
            tetrapod metaweb <span class="citation"

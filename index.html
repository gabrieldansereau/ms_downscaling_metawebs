                <dd>Knowledge about how ecological networks vary across
            global scales is currently limited given the complexity of
            acquiring repeated spatial data for species interactions.
            Yet, recent developments of metawebs highlight efficient
            ways to first document possible interactions within regional
            species pools. Downscaling metawebs towards local network
            predictions is a promising approach to use current data to
            investigate the variation of networks across space. However,
            issues remain in how to represent the spatial variability
            and uncertainty of species interactions, especially for
            large-scale food webs. Here, we present a probabilistic
            framework to downscale a metaweb based on the Canadian
            mammal metaweb and species occurrences from global
            databases. We investigated how our approach can be used to
            represent the variability of networks and communities
            between ecoregions in Canada. Species richness and
            interactions followed a similar latitudinal gradient across
            ecoregions but simultaneously identified contrasting
            diversity hotspots. Network motifs revealed additional areas
            of variation in network structure compared to species
            richness and number of links. Our method offers the
            potential to bring global predictions down to a more
            actionable local scale, and increases the diversity of
            ecological networks that can be projected in space.</dd>

            <p>Because species interactions vary in time and space, and

            geographical bias by focusing sampling efforts in a few

            <p>When assembled by integrating different data sources (and
            potentially with additional predictive steps), the metaweb
            allows to overcome sampling limitations and to raise network
            data to a global scale. For example, <span class="citation"

            structure should be the core goal of predictive network
            ecology. Assuming there is a strong link between the metaweb
            and its local realizations, more accurate predictions of the

            predicting the metaweb should be the first target in
            communities where data about local realizations
            (<em>i.e.</em>, documented interactions at specific places)
            are lacking. Our approach differs from using interactions to

            different task serving a different goal: focusing first on

            <p>Explicit spatial predictions of the structure of species
            interaction networks (downscaled metaweb predictions) are
            essential, as they allow comparisons with extant work for

            Further comparisons between network structure and other
            community properties are relevant as they may highlight new
            and surprising elements regarding network biogeography. For
            instance, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Frelat2022FooWeb">Frelat <em>et al.</em>
            (2022)</span> found a strong spatial coupling between
            community composition and food web structure, but a temporal
            mismatch depending on the spatial scale. <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2017HosPar">Poisot <em>et
            al.</em> (2017)</span> found that interaction uniqueness
            captures more composition variability than community
            uniqueness, and that sites with exceptional compositions
            might differ for networks and communities, because species
            distributions and species interactions had different
            bioclimatic drivers. Spatialized network data will allow
            these comparisons, identifying important conservation
            targets for networks and whether they differ geographically
            from areas currently prioritized for biodiversity
            conservation.</p>
            <p>Yet, downscaling a regional metaweb towards local network
            predictions that reflect the spatial variability of
            interactions remains an important methodological challenge.
            Even when the metaweb is known, local networks have been
            shown to vary substantially and differ both amongst
            themselves and from the metaweb <span class="citation"
            data-cites="McLeod2021SamAsy">(McLeod <em>et al.</em>
            2021)</span>. This emphasizes the need for methods to
            generate local, downscaled network predictions. A potential
            limitation to previous downscaling approaches is that they
            assumed interactions are equiprobable across space, which
            ignores well-documented interaction variability, and masks
            the effect of environmental conditions on interaction
            realization <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Braga2019SpaAna">(Braga <em>et al.</em>
            2019)</span>. As a consequence, this can over-represent
            interactions locally, but also lead to local predicted
            networks that are more homogeneous than they should. In
            contrast, recent studies argued that seeing interactions as
            probabilistic (rather than binary) events allows us to
            account for their variability in space <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span> and that this should also be

            and showed how it could be used for modelling interaction
            distributions. This approach to downscaling is especially
            relevant when combined with <em>in situ</em> observations of
            interactions and local networks to train interaction models.

            where hundreds of species result in tens of thousands of
            species pairs that may potentially interact, over
            continental-scale spatial extents. We currently lack a
            downscaling framework that is both probabilistic and can be
            trained without replicated <em>in situ</em> interaction
            data. But the lack of <em>in situ</em> interaction data
            actually constitutes an interesting opportunity: adopting a
            probabilistic view can allow propagating uncertainty, which
            can play a key role in evaluating the quality (and expected
            variability) of the predictions. Assessing model uncertainty
            would enable us to determine to which degree we should trust
            our predictions and to identify what to do to improve the
            current knowledge.</p>
            <p>Here, we present a workflow to downscale a metaweb in
            space, and illustrate it by spatially reconstructing local
            instances of a probabilistic metaweb of Canadian mammals. We
            do so using a probabilistic approach to both species
            distributions and interactions in a system without spatially
            replicated interaction data. We then explore how the spatial
            structure of the downscaled metaweb varies in space and how
            the uncertainty in predicted interactions can be made
            spatially explicit. We further show that the downscaled
            metaweb can highlight important biodiversity areas and bring
            novel ecological insight compared to traditional community
            measures like species richness or compositional uniqueness.
            We conclude by listing key considerations for the validation
            of such predictions.</p>
            <h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
            <p>In Fig.¬†1, we present a conceptual overview of the
            predictive pipeline leading to the downscaled metaweb. Its
            components were grouped as non-spatial and spatial data,
            localized site steps (divided into species, species-pair,
            and network level steps), and the final downscaled,
            spatialized metaweb. Throughout these steps, we highlight
            the importance of presenting the uncertainty of interactions
            and their distribution in space, as well as the variability
            in the structure of reconstructed networks. We argue that
            this requires adopting a probabilistic view of both species
            presence and interactions, and incorporating this variation
            between scales.</p>

            <p>We collected probabilistic interaction data from the

            represents interactions between mammals that can occur
            anywhere in Canada. It contains 163 species, and 3280 links
            with a non-zero probability of interaction. The species list
            for the Canadian metaweb was extracted from the
            International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
            checklist <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2022)</span>. The metaweb was reconstructed using graph
            embedding and phylogenetic transfer learning based on the
            metaweb of European terrestrial mammals, which is itself
            based on a comprehensive survey of interactions reported in
            the scientific literature <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Maiorano2020TetSpe">(Maiorano <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span> ‚Äì the European metaweb is likely the most
            extensive collective collection of such interactions
            available today. The Canadian metaweb showed a 91% success
            rate in its correct identification of known interactions
            between Canadian mammals recorded in global databases <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">(Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>. This metaweb is probabilistic,
            which has the advantage of reflecting the likelihood of an
            interaction taking place given the phylogenetic and trait
            match between two species; in other words, the probability
            of an interaction in the metaweb describes our confidence in
            the biological feasibility of this interaction. This allows
            incorporating interaction variability between species
            (<em>i.e.</em>, taking into account that two species may not
            always interact whenever or wherever they occur); however,
            other factors beyond trait and phylogenetic matching
            (<em>e.g.</em>, population densities) will also contribute
            to observed interaction frequencies.</p>

            <p>Downscaling the metaweb involved combining it with
            species occurrence and environmental data. First, we
            extracted species occurrences from the Global Biodiversity
            Information Facility (GBIF; <a
            href="www.gbif.org">www.gbif.org</a>) for the Canadian
            mammals after reconciling species names between the Canadian
            metaweb and GBIF using the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="GBIFSecretariat2021GbiBac">(GBIF Secretariat
            2021)</span>. This step removed potential duplicates by
            combining species listed in the Canadian metaweb which were
            considered as a single entity by GBIF. We collected
            occurrences for the updated species list (159 species) using
            the GBIF download API on October 21st 2022 <span
            class="citation" data-cites="GBIF.org2022GbiOcc">(GBIF.org
            2022)</span>. We restricted our query to occurrences with
            coordinates between longitudes 175¬∞W to 45¬∞W and latitudes
            10¬∞N to 90¬∞N. This was meant to collect training data
            covering a broader range than our prediction target (Canada
            only) and include observations in similar environments.
            Then, since GBIF observations represent presence-only data
            and most predictive models require absence data, we
            generated the same number of pseudo-absence data as
            occurrences for every species <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Barbet-Massin2012SelPse">(Barbet-Massin <em>et

            distance to a known observation (separately for each
            species) using the <code>DistanceToEvent</code> method from
            the <em>Julia</em> package
            <code>SpeciesDistributionToolkit</code>, making it more
            likely to select sites further away from an observation and
            the known species range. This is because our intent was to
            model the potential distribution of species, capturing wider
            responses to the environment, as the downscaled metaweb we
            aimed to produce is potential in nature (see <em>Downscaled
            metaweb</em> section below). We used the Haversine distance
            between observation and candidate pseudo-absence cells when
            drawing pseudo-absences.</p>
            <h3 id="environmental-data">Environmental data</h3>

            habitat suitability across the country, which we treated as

            related occurrences and pseudo-absences with 19 bioclimatic
            variables from CHELSA <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Karger2017CliHig">(Karger <em>et al.</em>

            (<em>BIO1</em>-<em>BIO19</em>) represent various measures of
            temperature and precipitation (<em>e.g.</em>, annual
            averages, monthly maximum or minimum, seasonality) and are
            available for land areas across the globe. We used the most
            recent version, the CHELSA v2.1 dataset <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Karger2021CliHig">(Karger
            <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span>, and subsetted it to land

            data-cites="Karger2018DatCli">(Karger <em>et al.</em>
            2018)</span>, which does not cover open water (this is
            appropriate as the data we use as input only cover
            terrestrial mammals). The EarthEnv land-cover variables
            represent classes such as Evergreen broadleaf trees,
            Cultivated and managed vegetation, Urban/Built-up, and Open
            Water. Values range between 0 and 100 and represent the
            consensus prevalence of each class in percentage within a
            pixel (hereafter called a ‚Äúsite‚Äù). We coarsened both the
            CHELSA and EarthEnv data from their original 30 arc-second
            resolution to a 2.5 arc-minute one (around 4.5 km at the

            capturing both local variations and broad-scale patterns
            while limiting computation costs to a manageable level as
            memory requirements rapidly increase with spatial

            <p>Our selection criteria for choosing an SDM algorithm was

            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">(similar to
            Gravel <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>, including both a
            probability of occurrence for a species in a specific site
            and the uncertainty associated with the prediction. These
            were crucial to obtaining a probabilistic version of the
            metaweb as they were used to create spatial variations in
            the localized interaction probabilities (see next section).
            One suitable method for this is Gradient Boosted Trees with
            a Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator from the
            <code>EvoTrees.jl</code> <em>Julia</em> package (<a
            href="https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl">https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl</a>).
            This method returns a prediction for every site with an
            average value and a standard deviation, which we considered
            as a measure of uncertainty; specifically, the output of a
            Gaussian MLL BRT is the probability distribution of
            observing the positive (<em>i.e.</em>, presence) class. We
            used the mean and standard deviation of the predicted
            outcome to build a Normal distribution for the probability
            of occurrence of a given species at each site (represented
            as probability distributions on Fig.¬†1). We trained models
            across the extent chosen for occurrences (longitudes 175¬∞W
            to 45¬∞W and latitudes 10¬∞N to 90¬∞N), then predicted species
            distributions only for Canada. We used the 2021 Census
            Boundary Files from Statistics Canada <span class="citation"
            data-cites="StatisticsCanada2022BouFil">(Statistics Canada

            metaweb. The four sampling options were intended to explore
            how uncertainty and variation in the species distributions
            can affect the metaweb result. We expected thresholding to
            have a more pronounced effect on network structure as it
            should reduce the number of links by removing many of the
            rare interactions <span class="citation"

            to create higher spatial heterogeneity compared to the mean
            probabilities, as including some extreme values should
            confound the main trends promoted by environmental
            gradients. We chose option 1 to present our results as it is
            intuitive and essentially represents the result of a
            probabilistic SDM <span class="citation"

            strategies are available in Supplementary Material.</p>
            <p>Next, the two-species steps were aimed at assigning a
            probability of observing an interaction between two species
            in a given site. For each species pair, we multiplied the
            product of the two species‚Äô occurrence probabilities
            (<em>P(co-occurrence</em>); Fig.¬†1) (obtained using one of
            the sampling options above) by their interaction probability
            in the Canadian metaweb. For cases where species in the
            Canadian metaweb were considered as the same species by the
            GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (the reconciliation step mentioned
            earlier), we used the highest interaction probabilities
            involving the duplicated species.</p>
            <p>The network-level steps then created the probabilistic
            metaweb for the site. We assembled all the local interaction
            probabilities (from the two-species steps) into a
            probabilistic network <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span>. We then sampled several random network
            realizations to represent the potential local realization

            data-cites="Poisot2015SpeWhy">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2015)</span>. This resulted in a distribution of localized
            networks, which we averaged over the number of simulations
            to obtain a single probabilistic network for the site.</p>
            <h3 id="downscaled-metaweb">Downscaled metaweb</h3>
            <p>The final output of our workflow was the downscaled
            metaweb, which contains a localized probabilistic metaweb in
            every site across the study area (<em>Outputs</em> box in
            Fig.¬†1). The metaweb sets an upper bound on the potential
            interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2023GraEmb">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2023)</span>, therefore, the downscaled metaweb is a refined
            upper boundary at the local scale that takes into account
            co-occurrences. It is still potential in nature and differs
            from a local realization, from which it should have a
            different structure. Nonetheless, from the downscaled
            metaweb, we can create maps of network properties
            (<em>e.g.</em>, number of links, connectance) measured on
            the local probabilities of species interactions and
            occurrences, and compute some traditional community-level
            measures such as species richness. We chose to compute and

            simplified the representation of their distribution by

            the distributions. We also measured within-ecoregion

            uniqueness for networks by computing the values over the

            unique sites and uniqueness variability than through species

            data-cites="Poisot2017HosPar">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2017)</span>. Here, we measured and compared the uniqueness
            of our localized community and network predictions. For
            species composition, we assembled a site-by-species
            community matrix (970,698 sites by 159 species) with the
            probability of occurrence of each species at every site
            obtained in the species distribution models. For network
            composition, we assembled a site-by-interaction matrix with
            the localized probability of interaction at every site given
            by the downscaled metaweb (therefore, 970,698 sites by 3,108
            interactions with defined probabilities in the metaweb). We
            applied the Hellinger transformation on both matrices and
            computed the LCBD values from the total variance in the

            to the overall variance and a unique species or interaction
            composition compared to other sites. Since the values
            themselves are very low given our high number of sites <span

            primarily is the magnitude of the difference between the
            sites. Given this, we divided values by the maximum value in
            each matrix (species or network) and suggest that these
            should be viewed as relative contributions compared to the
            highest observed contribution. As with other measures, we
            then summarized the local uniqueness values by ecoregion by
            taking the median LCBD value and measuring the 89%

            chains), S2 (omnivory), S4 (exploitative competition) and S5
            (apparent competition). These motifs can be grouped into two
            pairs according to their ecological information: S1 and S2
            highlight different trophic structures, while S4 and S5
            indicate different competition types. Therefore, we compared
            the spatial distribution of the motifs in each pair to see
            which ones were dominant across all our sites. First, we
            computed the expected motif count for each of the four
            motifs for all sites using the localized probabilistic
            networks from the downscaled metaweb <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(following Poisot <em>et
            al.</em> 2016)</span>. Then, we compared the expected counts
            of the motifs within the two pairs. To do so, we used a
            normalized difference measure similar to the Normalized
            Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), where we compute the
            difference between the two motif counts over their sum. We
            called the index comparing the two trophic motifs (S1 and
            S2) the Normalized Difference Trophic Index (NDTI) and the
            one comparing the competition motifs (S4 and S5) the
            Normalized Difference Competition Index. We defined both
            indexes as: <span class="math display">$$NDTI =
            \frac{(S1 - S2)}{(S1 +S2)}$$</span> <span
            class="math display">$$NDCI = \frac{(S4 - S5)}{(S4
            +S5)}$$</span> Values for both indexes are bounded between
            -1 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that both motifs have the
            same expected counts. Positive values indicate that the
            first motif in each index (S1 and S4) is dominant and has a
            higher expected count, while negative values indicate that
            the second motif (S2 and S5) is dominant. As with previous
            measures, we then summarized both index values by ecoregion
            by taking the ecoregion median and measuring its
            within-ecoregion variation with the 89% interquantile range.
            Ecoregion values therefore indicate if one type of trophic
            structure (for NDTI) and one type of competition (for NDCI)
            is dominant in the ecoregion, while the interquantile range
            values measure whether the dominant type varies within the
            ecoregion.</p>

            <p>Our workflow allowed us to display the spatial
            distribution of ecoregion-level community measures (here,
            expected species richness) and network measures (expected
            number of links; Fig.¬†2). We highlight that the measures
            presented here are first computed over the predicted
            communities and networks obtained when downscaling the
            metaweb, then summarized across the ecoregions (taking the
            median within each ecoregion). They are not a direct
            prediction of the measure itself (<em>e.g.</em>, we do not
            present a prediction of actual species richness at each
            location). Expected ecoregion richness (Fig.¬†2A) and
            expected number of links (Fig.¬†2B) displayed similar
            distributions with a latitudinal gradient and higher values
            in the south. Within-ecoregion variability was distributed
            slightly differently with a less constant latitudinal
            gradient, notably lower interquantile ranges near the
            southern border (for example, near Vancouver Island and the
            Rockies on the West Coast, and near the Ontario Peninsula,
            the Saint-Lawrence Valley, and Central New-Brunswick in the
            East; Fig.¬†2C-D). Bivariate comparison of the distributions
            of species richness and expected number of links and of
            their respective within-ecoregion variability further shows
            some areas of mismatches, indicating that richness and links
            do not co-vary completely although they may show similar
            distributions for median values (see Supplementary Material,
            Fig. S1). All results shown are based on the first sampling
            strategy (option 1) mentioned in the <em>Building site-level
            instances of the metaweb</em> section, where we used the
            mean value of the species distributions as the species

            <p>Our results also indicate a mismatch between the
            uniqueness of communities and networks (Fig.¬†3). Uniqueness
            was higher mostly in the north and along the south border
            for communities, but mainly in the north for networks
            (Fig.¬†3A-B). Consequently, ecoregions with both unique
            community composition and unique network composition were
            mostly in the north (Fig.¬†3C). Meanwhile, some areas were
            unique for one element but not the other. For instance,
            ecoregions along the south border had a unique species
            composition but a more common network composition (Fig.¬†3C).
            Two ecoregions showed the opposite (unique network
            compositions only) at higher latitudes (Davis Highlands
            tundra, near 70¬∞N, and Southern Hudson Bay taiga, near
            54¬∞N). Moreover, network uniqueness values for ecoregions
            spanned a narrower range between the 44 ecoregions than
            species LCBD values (Fig.¬†3D, left). Within-ecoregion
            variation was also lower for network values with generally
            lower 89% interquantile ranges among the site-level LCBD
            values (Fig.¬†3D, right).</p>

            <p>Comparing the distribution of dominant network motifs
            revealed additional areas of variation in network structure
            (Fig.¬†4). NDTI displayed a latitudinal gradient between the
            trophic motifs. Northern ecoregions showed positive NDTI
            values and high dominance of S1 (tri-trophic chains)
            expected counts compared to S2 (omnivory) but ecoregions
            along the south border showed a reduced dominance (Fig.¬†4A).
            Ecoregions near the Ontario Peninsula and Saint-Lawrence
            Valley showed values close to zero, indicating a balance
            between two motifs, while Central New Brunswick had slightly
            negative values, indicating a low dominance of S2. In
            comparison, NDCI values showed an evenly high dominance of
            S5 (apparent competition) over S4 (exploitative competition)
            across all ecoregions (Fig.¬†4B). Meanwhile, within-ecoregion
            variance displayed a different spatial distribution from the
            median values. NDTI interquantile ranges spanned a wide
            range of values and were higher both in the north and in the
            south (although not in the ecoregions with higher NDTI
            median values) (Fig.¬†4C). On the other hand, NDCI
            interquantile ranges showed lower within-ecoregion variance
            in most ecoregions except in the northernmost one (Canadian
            High Arctic tundra), which has a notably higher value¬≠
            (Fig.¬†4D). Although this higher variance does not reflect in
            the NDCI median values, it does appear when looking at the
            site-level values, where this ecoregion is the only one with
            patches with high positive NDCI values (indicating a
            dominance of S4) surrounded by highly negative values
            (indicating a dominance of S5) as in other ecoregions (Fig.

            <p>As our approach is probabilistic, it does not assume
            species interact whenever they co-occur and incorporates
            variability based on environmental conditions (via projected
            species distributions), which could lead to different
            results by introducing a different association between
            species richness and network properties. <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Galiana2021SpaSca">Galiana
            <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span> found that species richness
            had a large explanatory power over network properties, but
            mentioned this could potentially be due to interactions
            between species being constant across space. Here, we found
            that potential species richness and number of links
            displayed similar distributions following a latitudinal
            gradient, but that the within-ecoregion variance was lower
            along the southern border than the measures themselves
            (Fig.¬†2). The causes for this lack of consistency at the
            eco-region scale could be verified in future studies; for
            instance, higher urban density in the south can create more
            heterogeneity within an eco-region, and the variability in
            network structure may reflect true landscape variability
            within eco-regions. We found that network density (links on
            Fig.¬†2B) was lower in the north, which is contrary to what
            was observed in Europe for the terrestrial tetrapod metaweb

            regions. However, those are systems with different numbers
            of species and environmental conditions (<em>e.g.</em>,
            Europe and Canada could differ due to varying climatic
            conditions, land-use, and species composition at the same
            latitudes). Further research should investigate why these
            results might differ between continents and ecological
            systems and whether it is due to the methodology, data, or
            biogeographical processes.</p>
            <p>Our LCBD and uniqueness results highlighted that areas
            with unique network composition differ from sites with
            unique species composition. In other words, the joint
            distribution of community and network uniqueness highlights
            different diversity hotspots. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2017HosPar">Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            (2017)</span> showed a similar result with host-parasite
            communities of rodents and ectoparasitic fleas. Our results
            further show that these differences could be distributed
            across ecoregions and over a broad spatial extent for mammal
            food webs. LCBD scores essentially highlight variability
            hotspots and are a measure of the variance of community or
            network structure. Here, they also serve as an
            inter-ecoregion variation measure, which can be compared to
            the within-ecoregion variation highlighted by the
            interquantile ranges. The narrower range of values for
            network LCBD values and the lower IQR values indicate that
            both the inter-ecoregion and within-ecoregion variation are
            lower for networks than for species (Fig.¬†3).</p>
            <p>Our analysis of the distribution of dominant network
            motifs revealed additional areas of variation in network
            structure. Trophic motifs (S1 and S2, measured through NDTI
            values) showed a latitudinal gradient different from the
            richness and links ones, with high dominance of tri-trophic
            chains (S1) in the north and higher omnivory counts (S2)
            only in a few ecoregions in the south. These results did not
            seem related to ecoregion variance, which once again showed
            a very different distribution from the median values.
            Meanwhile, competition motifs (S4 and S5, measured through
            NDCI values) showed an even dominance of apparent
            competition (S5) but high variance in a single ecoregion.
            Overall, our results show that dominant motifs within a
            mammal food web not only vary between ecoregions, but
            actually vary differently across space.</p>
            <p>When to use the workflow we presented here will depend on
            the availability of interaction data or existing metawebs,
            and on the intent to incorporate interaction variability, as
            well as ecoregion-level variability. In systems where <em>in
            situ</em> interaction and complete network data are
            available, the approach put forward by <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Gravel2019BriElt">Gravel <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span> achieves a similar purpose as we
            attempted here, but is more rigorous and allows modelling
            the effect of the environment on the interactions
            themselves. Without such data, establishing or predicting
            the metaweb (<em>e.g.</em>, using transfer learning) should
            be the first step toward producing localized predictions
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2023GraEmb">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2023)</span>. Our framework then downscales the metaweb
            towards the localized predictions, here using the
            probabilistic Canadian mammal one, but it can also use other
            metawebs generated through various means. Well-documented
            binary ones such as the European tetrapod metaweb could be
            partly combined with our approach if used with probabilistic
            SDMs and summarized by ecoregions (as they would only lack
            an initial probabilistic metaweb, but would still obtain a
            more probabilistic output). Our approach will essentially
            differ from previous attempts in how it perceives
            uncertainty and variability. For instance, rare interactions
            should not be over-represented <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span> and should have lesser effects over computed
            network measures. Furthermore, summarizing results by
            ecoregion allows for showing variation within and between
            ecologically meaningful biogeographic boundaries <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Martins2022GloReg">(Martins
            <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>, which, as our results showed,
            is not constant across space and can help identify
            contrasting diversity hotspots.</p>
            <p>Although our approach can generate a wealth of
            predictions, the next step is quite obviously to work on the
            validation of these predictions. This step is mandatory if
            the predictions are to be made actionable. Nevertheless,
            developing a way to generate these predictions when
            information is initially scarce, as we present here, is
            highly important in itself: it establishes a baseline for
            what the expected measurements will look like, but also
            (through quantification of variability and uncertainty)
            provides an estimate of where a more sustained effort is
            required to adequately document food web structure. For
            instance, documenting interactions at a single location in
            an eco-region with high variability of predicted network
            structure may ultimately be less informative, whereas more
            homogeneous eco-regions constitute ‚Äúlow-hanging fruits‚Äù for
            validation. Any future sampling of food web structure can be
            used to (in)validate the predictions: they can be fed into
            the model to iterate these results again, and by decreasing
            the uncertainty associated to the interactions, can boost
            the accuracy of the entire model. There are two external
            sources of information that can also increase the predictive
            ability of the model. Because the downscaling relies on
            SDMs, any additional documentation of species presences can
            be reflected in the network prediction. Furthemore, because
            the metaweb itself was obtained through transfer learning
            from data describing a different system, any change to the
            knowledge in this other data can be reflected in the input
            data. As <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2023GraEmb">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2023)</span> point out, validation of metaweb predictions,
            empirical sampling, and method design should all proceed
            jointly, and making conceptual progress in one of these
            areas helps all the others. In this manuscript, we focused
            on motif composition, both for its relevance to functional
            properties of food webs, but also because it can be fairly
            reliably infered from partial network data; in other words,
            validating some predictions is not necessarily relying upon
            exhaustive documentation of local food webs.</p>
            <p>The recent shift in focus towards building metawebs opens
            many opportunities for projections of networks in space
            through probabilistic downscaling, as we suggested here.
            Metawebs have been documented in many systems, allowing us
            to build new ones from predictions. How the European
            tetrapod metaweb <span class="citation"

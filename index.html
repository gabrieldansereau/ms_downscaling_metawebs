            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Here, we present a method to downscale a metaweb in space
            by developing an explicit spatial probabilistic metaweb for
            Canadian mammals. We present how the spatial structure of
            the downscaled metaweb varies in space and how the
            uncertainty of interactions can be made spatially explicit.
            We further show that the downscaled metaweb can highlight
            important biodiversity areas and bring novel ecological
            insights compared to community measures.</p>
            <h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
            <p>Fig. 1 shows a conceptual overview of the methodological
            steps leading to the downscaled metaweb. The components were
            grouped as the inputs (spatial or non-spatial), the
            localized steps (divided into single-species-level,
            two-species-level, and network-level steps), and the final
            downscaled and spatialized output. Throughout these steps,
            we highlight the importance of presenting the uncertainty of
            both interactions and their distribution in space. We argue
            that this requires adopting a probabilistic view and
            incorporating variation between scales.</p>

            <p>The inputs were divided into two main categories: the

            <h3 id="non-spatial-inputs">Non-spatial inputs</h3>
            <p>The main building block for the interaction data was the
            metaweb for Canadian mammals from <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2022a)</span>, a non-spatial input (represented as nodes
            and links on Fig. 1). A metaweb contains all the possible
            interactions between the species found in a given regional
            species pool <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dunne2006NetStr">(Dunne 2006)</span>. The
            species list for the Canadian metaweb was extracted from the
            International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
            checklist <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2022a)</span>. Briefly, the metaweb was developed using
            graph embedding and phylogenetic transfer learning based on
            the metaweb of European mammals, which is itself based on a
            comprehensive survey of interactions reported in the
            scientific literature <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Maiorano2020TetSpe">(Maiorano <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. The Canadian metaweb is probabilistic, which
            has the advantage of taking into account that species do not
            necessarily interact whenever they co-occur <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Blanchet2020CoOcc">(Blanchet
            <em>et al.</em> 2020)</span>. However, the Canadian metaweb
            is not explicitly spatial: it only gives information on
            interactions in Canada as a whole and does not represent
            networks at specific locations. Local networks, on the other
            hand, are realizations from the metaweb resulting from
            sorting the species and the interactions <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2015SpeWhy">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. A spatial and localized
            metaweb is not equivalent to the local networks, as it will
            have a different structure and a higher connectance <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2022PreMet">(Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> 2022b)</span>. Therefore, producing a
            spatial metaweb requires additional steps to account for
            species composition and interaction variability in
            space.</p>
            <h3 id="spatial-inputs">Spatial inputs</h3>
            <p>The spatial data used to develop the spatial component of
            the metaweb were species occurrences and environmental data.
            First, we extracted species occurrences from the Global
            Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org) for
            the Canadian mammals after reconciling species names between
            the Canadian metaweb and GBIF using the GBIF Backbone
            Taxonomy <span class="citation"
            data-cites="GBIFSecretariat2021GbiBac">(GBIF Secretariat
            2021)</span>. Doing so, we removed potential duplicates
            where species listed in the Canadian metaweb are considered
            as a single entity by GBIF. We collected occurrences for our
            species list (159 species) using the GBIF download API on
            October 21st 2022 <span class="citation"
            data-cites="GBIF.org2022GbiOcc">(GBIF.org 2022)</span>. We
            restricted our query to occurrences with coordinates between
            longitudes 175°W to 45°W and latitudes 10°N to 90°N. This
            was meant to collect training data covering a broader range
            than our prediction target (Canada only) and include
            observations in similar environments. Then, since GBIF
            observations represent presence-only data and most
            predictive models require absence data, we generated
            pseudo-absence data using the surface range envelope method
            available in <code>SimpleSDMLayers.jl</code> <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Dansereau2021SimJl">(Dansereau
            &amp; Poisot 2021)</span>. This method generates
            pseudo-absences by selecting random non-observed locations

            <p>We used environmental data and species distribution
            models <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Guisan2005PreSpe">(SDMs, Guisan &amp; Thuiller
            2005)</span> to predict the distribution of Canadian mammals
            across the whole country. The environmental data we used
            were the 19 bioclimatic variables from CHELSA <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Karger2017CliHig">(Karger
            <em>et al.</em> 2017)</span> and the 12 consensus land cover
            variables from EarthEnv <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Tuanmu2014Glo1km">(Tuanmu &amp; Jetz
            2014)</span>. The CHELSA bioclimatic variables
            (<em>bio1-bio19</em>) represent various measures of
            temperature and precipitation (e.g., annual averages,
            monthly maximum or minimum, seasonality) and are available
            for land areas across the globe. Therefore, they can be used
            to capture the climatic tolerance of species and model
            habitat suitability in new locations. We used the most
            recent version, the CHELSA v2.1 dataset <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Karger2021CliHig">(Karger
            <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span>. However, this version also
            includes bioclimatic data for open water, while we decided
            here to focus only on land surfaces. We used the previous

            open water, as a mask to clip the v2.1 data to land surfaces
            only. The EarthEnv land cover variables represent classes
            such as Evergreen broadleaf trees, Cultivated and managed

            between 0 and 100 and represent the consensus prevalence of
            each class in percentage within a pixel. We coarsened both
            the CHELSA and EarthEnv data from their original 30
            arc-second resolution to a 2.5 arc-mininute one (around 4.5

            catch both local variations and broad scale patterns while
            limiting computation costs to a manageable level, as memory
            requirements on localized interactions rise very
            quickly.</p>
            <p>Our selection criteria for choosing an SDM algorithm was
            to have a method that generated probabilistic results,
            including both a probability of occurrence for a species in
            a specific location and the uncertainty associated with the
            prediction. These were crucial to obtaining a probabilistic
            version of the metaweb as they were used to create spatial
            variations in the localized interaction probabilities (see
            next section). One promising method for this is Gradient
            Boosted Trees with a Gaussian maximum likelihood from the
            <code>EvoTrees.jl</code> <em>Julia</em> package
            (https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl). This method
            returns a prediction for every pixel with an average value
            and a standard deviation, which we used as a measure of
            uncertainty to build a Normal distribution for the
            probability of occurrence of a given species at all pixels
            (represented as probability distributions on Fig. 1). We
            trained models across the extent chosen for occurrences
            (longitudes 175°W to 45°W and latitudes 10°N to 90°N), then
            predicted species distributions only for Canada. We used the
            2021 Census Boundary Files from Statistics Canada <span

            data-cites="StatisticsCanada2022BouFil">(Statistics Canada
            2022)</span> to set the boundaries for our predictions,
            which gave us 970,698 sites in total.</p>
            <h2 id="localized-steps">Localized steps</h2>
            <p>The next part of the method was the localized steps which
            produce local metawebs in every pixel. This component was
            divided into single-species, two-species, and network-level
            steps (<em>Localized steps</em> box on Fig. 1).</p>
            <p>The single-species steps represented four possible ways
            to account for uncertainty in the species distributions and
            bring variation to the spatial metaweb. We explored four
            different options to select a value from the occurrence
            distributions obtained in the previous steps (Inputs
            section): 1) taking the mean from the distribution as the
            probability of occurrence (option 1 on Fig. 1); 2)
            converting the mean value to a binary one using a specific
            threshold per species (option 2); 3) sampling a random value
            within the Normal distribution (option 3); 4) converting the
            random value into a binary result (option 4). The threshold
            (<span class="math inline"><em>τ</em></span> on Fig. 1) used
            was the value that maximized Youden’s <em>J</em>

            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2022a)</span> at an intermediate step while building the
            metaweb. The four sampling options were intended to explore
            how uncertainty and variation in the species distributions
            can affect the metaweb result and reproduce some of the
            filterings that create the local network realizations <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2015SpeWhy">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. We expected thresholding to
            have a more pronounced effect on network structure as it
            should reduce the number of links by removing many of the
            rare interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span>. Meanwhile, we expected random sampling to
            create spatial heterogeneity compared to the mean
            probabilities, as including some extreme values should
            disrupt the potential effects of environmental
            gradients.</p>
            <p>Next, the two-species steps aimed to give the probability
            of observing a given interaction in a location. For all
            species pairs, we multiplied the two species’ occurrence
            probability obtained using the sampling options described in
            the previous paragraph, then multiplied the co-occurrence
            probability by the interaction probability from the Canadian
            metaweb. For cases where species in the Canadian metaweb
            were considered as the same species by the GBIF Backbone
            Taxonomy (the reconciliation step mentioned earlier), we
            used the highest interaction probabilities involving the
            duplicated species.</p>
            <p>The network-level steps then created the probabilistic
            metaweb for the location. We assembled all the local
            interaction probabilities (from the two-species steps) into
            a probabilistic network <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016StrPro">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span>. We then sampled several random network
            realizations to represent the potential local realization
            process <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2015SpeWhy">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2015)</span>. Finally, this resulted in a distribution of
            localized networks, which we averaged over the number of
            simulations to obtain a probabilistic network.</p>
            <h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>
            <p>The final output of our method was the spatial
            probabilistic metaweb, which contains a localized
            probabilistic metaweb in every cell across the student
            extent (Outputs box on Fig. 1). This gives us an idea of the
            possible networks in all locations as the metaweb
            essentially serves to set an upper bound on the potential
            interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022PreMet">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2022b)</span>, but with the added benefit of accounting for
            co-occurrence probabilities in this case. From there, we can
            create maps of network properties (e.g. number of links,
            connectance) measured on the local realizations, display
            their spatial distribution, and compute some community-level
            measures such as species richness. We can also calculate the
            uncertainty associated with the network and community
            measurements and contrast their spatial distribution (see
            Supplementary Material).</p>
            <h3 id="ecoregions">Ecoregions</h3>
            <p>Since both species composition and network summary values
            display a high spatial variation and complex patterns, we
            simplified the representation of their distribution by
            grouping sites by ecoregion, as species and interaction
            composition have been shown to differ between ecoregions

            calculated the measure for every site separately, then we
            extracted the median value for each ecoregion. We also
            measured the within-ecoregion variation by measuring the 89%

            uniqueness for networks by computing the values over the
            adjacency matrix, which has been shown to capture more
            unique sites and uniqueness variability than through species

            of our localized community and network predictions. For
            species composition, we assembled a site-by-species
            community matrix with the probability of occurrence at every
            location from the species distribution models. For network
            composition, we assembled a site-by-interaction matrix with
            the localized interaction values from the spatial
            probabilistic metaweb. We applied the Hellinger
            transformation on both matrices and computed the LCBD values
            from the total variance in the matrices <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Legendre2013BetDiv">(Legendre
            &amp; De Cáceres 2013)</span>. High LCBD values indicate a
            high contribution to the overall variance and a unique
            species or interaction composition compared to other sites.
            Since values themselves are very low given our high number
            of sites <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dansereau2022EvaEco">(similar to Dansereau
            <em>et al.</em> 2022)</span>, what matters primarily is the
            magnitude of the difference between the sites. Given this,
            we divided values by the maximum value in each matrix
            (species or network) and suggest that these should be viewed
            as relative contributions compared to the highest observed
            contribution. As with other measures, we then summarized the
            local uniqueness values by ecoregion by taking the median
            LCBD value and measuring the 89% interquantile range within
            all ecoregions.</p>

            <h1 id="results">Results</h1>
            <p>Our method allowed us to display the spatial distribution
            of ecoregion-level measures (Fig. 2), either for community
            measures (e.g. expected species richness) or for network
            measures (e.g. expected number of links). Importantly, both
            community and network-level measures presented are not
            predictions of the measure itself but were instead computed
            over localized predictions of the communities and networks,
            then summarized for the ecoregions. Expected ecoregion
            richness (Fig. 2A), which is the median of the expected
            species richness of the sites within the ecoregion, and
            expected number of links (Fig. 2B) displayed similar
            distributions with a latitudinal gradient and higher values
            in the south. However, within-ecoregion variability was
            distributed differently, as some ecoregions along the coasts
            displayed higher interquantile ranges while ecoregions
            around the southern border displayed narrower ones
            (Fig. 2C-D). All results shown are based on the first
            sampling strategy (option 1) mentioned in the Localized
            steps section, where species occurrence probabilities were
            taken as the mean value of the distribution (results for
            other sampling strategies are discussed in Supplementary

            <p>Direct comparison of the spatial distributions of species
            richness and expected number of links showed some areas with
            mismatches, both regarding the median estimates and
            regarding the within-ecoregion variability (Fig. 3). Median
            values for the ecoregions showed a similar bivariate
            distribution with ecoregions in the south mostly displaying
            high species richness and a high number of links (Fig. 3A).
            The northernmost ecoregions (Canadian High Artic Tundra and
            Davis Highlands Tundra) displayed higher richness (based on
            the quantile rank) compared to the number or links.
            Inversely, ecoregions further south (Canadian Low Artic
            Tundra, Northern Canadian Shield Taiga, Southern Hudson Bay
            Taiga) ranked higher for the number of links than for
            species richness. On the other hand, within-ecoregion
            variability showed different bivariate relationships and a
            less constant latitudinal gradient (Fig. 3B). This indicates
            that richness and link do not vary hand in hand (i.e. their
            variability is not closely connected) although they may show
            similar distributions for median values.</p>

            <p>Our results also indicate a mismatch between the
            uniqueness of communities and networks (Fig. 4). Uniqueness
            was higher mostly in the north and along the south border
            for communities, but only in the north for networks
            (Fig. 4A-B). Consequently, ecoregions with both unique
            community composition and unique network composition were
            mostly in the north (Fig. 4C). Meanwhile, some areas were
            unique for one element but not the other. For instance, the
            New England-Acadian forests ecoregion (south-east, near 70°W
            and 48°N) had a highly unique species composition but a more
            common network composition (Fig. 4C). Opposite areas with
            unique network compositions only were higher north between
            latitudes 52°N and 70°N (Eastern Canadian Shield Taiga,
            Northern Canadian Shield Taiga, Canadian Low Artic Tundra).
            When comparing the values, network uniqueness values for
            ecoregions spanned a narrower range between the 44
            ecoregions than species LCBD values (Fig. 4D, left).
            Within-ecoregion variation was also lower for network values
            with generally lower 89% interquantile ranges among the
            site-level LCBD values (Fig. 4D, right). Moreover,
            mismatched sites (unique for only one element) formed two

            species richness and the number of links (see Supplementary
            Material). The areas only unique for their species
            composition had both a high richness and number of links. On
            the other hand, the sites only unique for their networks had
            both lower richness and a lower number of links, although
            they were not the sites with the lowest values for both.</p>

            <p>The spatial probabilistic metaweb we produced here is a
            first attempt at downscaling a metaweb and producing
            localized predictions, as called for by <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2022PreMet">Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> (2022b)</span>. It gives us an idea of what
            local metawebs or networks could look like in space, given
            the species distributions and their variability, as well as
            the uncertainty around the interactions. It is the first
            representation in space of the metaweb of Canadian mammals
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2022FooWeb">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2022a)</span>, which is not spatialized. Conceptually, this
            is similar to how the European tetrapod metaweb <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Maiorano2020TetSpe">(Maiorano
            <em>et al.</em> 2020)</span> was used to predict localized

            <em>et al.</em> 2023)</span>. Therefore, our approach could
            open similar possibilities of investigations in North
            America with food webs of Canadian mammals, for instance on
            the structure of food webs over space <span class="citation"

            data-cites="Botella2023LanInt">(Botella <em>et al.</em>
            2023)</span>. Moreover, our approach is probabilistic, does
            not assume species interact whenever they co-occur, and
            incorporates variability based on environmental conditions,
            which could lead to different results by introducing a
            different association between species richness and network
            properties. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Galiana2021SpaSca">Galiana <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span> found that species richness had a large
            explanatory power over network properties but mentioned it
            could potentially be due to interactions between species
            being fixed in space. Here, we found mismatches in the
            distribution of species richness and interactions, and
            especially regarding their within-ecoregion variability
            (Fig. 3), highlighting that interactions might vary
            differently than species distributions in space. Network
            measures (links on Fig. 3A) were also lower in the north,
            contrarily to previous studies <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Braga2019SpaAna Galiana2021SpaSca">(e.g. connectance

            <p>Our LCBD and uniqueness results highlighted that areas
            with unique network composition might differ from sites with
            unique species composition. In other words, the joint
            distribution of community and network uniqueness highlights
            different diversity hotspots. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2017HosPar">Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            (2017)</span> showed a similar result with host-parasite
            communities of rodents and ecto-fleas. Our results further
            show how these differences could be distributed across
            ecoregions and a broad spatial extent. Areas unique for only
            one element (species or network composition) differed in
            their combination of species richness and number of links
            (supplementary material), with species-unique sites
            displaying high values of both measures and network-unique
            sites displaying low values. Moreover, LCBD scores
            essentially highlight variability hotspots and are a measure
            of the variance of community or network structure. Here they
            also serve as an inter-ecoregion variation measure which can
            be compared to the within-ecoregion variation highlighted by
            the interquantile ranges. The narrower range of values for
            network LCBD values and the lower IQR values indicate that
            both the inter-ecoregion and within-ecoregion variation are
            lower for network than for species (Fig. 4). Additionally,
            higher values for network LCBD also indicate that most
            ecoregions can hold ecologically unique sites.</p>
